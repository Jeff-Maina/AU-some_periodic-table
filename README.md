The following information is provided for each element:-
- Name of element.
- Chemical symbol.
- Group and Period
- Atomic number.
- Atomic mass.
- Atomic radius.
- Chemical family.
- Type of bonding.
- Electronic configuration.
- Van der Waals radius.
- Ionization energy ( in kj/mol ).
- Oxidation states.
- Boiling and Melting points.
- Standard state.
- Electron affinity and electronegativity.
- CPK coloring ( the color of the chemical symbol and name ).

<b>NOTE</b>
