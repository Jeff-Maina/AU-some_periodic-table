# AU-some_periodic-table

This project is an educational resource for learning about the elements that make up our universe. The periodic table is an organized chart that displays the chemical elements, including their atomic number, symbol, and name. The elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number, allowing for a clear understanding of their chemical and physical properties.The app fetches data from a <a href="https://api.npoint.io/de68b6bf88b29ffe56f5" target = "_blank">chemical elements api</a> which is then used throughtout the application.

## Technologies used

This project was built using:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- React
- Vercel (for deployment)

The periodic table is implemented as an HTML table and the information about each element is stored in a JSON file deployed using vercel. The interactive features of the periodic table are implemented using JavaScript.

## Features
- Interactive periodic table: The periodic table is presented in an interactive format that allows users to click on an element to learn more about its properties.
- Element information: Users can access information about each element including its :-
    - Name of element.
    - Chemical symbol.
    - Group and Period
    - Atomic number.
    - Atomic mass.
    - Atomic radius.
    - Chemical family.
    - Type of bonding.
    - Electronic configuration.
    - Van der Waals radius.
    - Ionization energy ( in kj/mol ).
    - Oxidation states.
    - Boiling and Melting points.
    - Standard state.
    - Electron affinity and electronegativity.
    - CPK coloring ( the color of the chemical symbol and name ).
- Definition of terms: A user can get definition of some of the terms above by clicking the term itself.
  e.g clicking "Chemical family" to check its definition
  
  <b>NOTE</b>
- Some of the information above may be missing for some of the elements.
